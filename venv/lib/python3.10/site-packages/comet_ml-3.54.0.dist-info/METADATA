Getting started: 30 seconds to Comet.ml
---------------------------------------

The core class of Comet.ml is an **Experiment**, a specific run of a
script that generated a result such as training a model on a single set
of hyper parameters. An Experiment will automatically log scripts output (stdout/stderr), code, and command
line arguments on **any** script and for the supported libraries will
also log hyper parameters, metrics and model configuration.

Here is the Experiment object:

.. code:: python

    from comet_ml import Experiment
    experiment = Experiment(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

    # Your code.

We all strive to be data driven and yet every day valuable experiments
results are just lost and forgotten. Comet.ml provides a dead simple way
of fixing that. Works with any workflow, any ML task, any machine and
any piece of code.
